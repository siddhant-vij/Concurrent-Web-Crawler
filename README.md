# Concurrent Web Crawler

Designed to showcase the development and performance of web crawlers using concurrent programming techniques across Java, C++, Go, and Python. This project aims to demonstrate how concurrency can significantly enhance web crawling efficiency, allowing for faster data retrieval and processing.
<br>
<br>
By implementing the crawler in multiple programming languages, the project provides insights into the concurrency models of each language and their practical application in web scraping tasks.
